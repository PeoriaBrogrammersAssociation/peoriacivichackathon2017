# Peoria Civic Hackathon Submission Example

This is a sample submission for the Peoria Civic Hackathon. This is just a sample of what your repo can look like when you submit it
to us as part of the final process for judging the hackathon.

## Description

Our tool gives Peoria Public Works the ability to do multi-platform broadcasting of current and planned construction projects.  
By sending coordinates of construction zones (beginning and end street intersections) plus affected duration to Maps Service Providers (Google, Apple, Waze, etc.) 
and Social Media Outlets, users can be led from a link in perhaps Facebook or Twitter to Google Maps, where they can see more information about a particular project 
as well as other construction zones in the city.  Or if you're using Navigation while traveling, your route may be adjusted accordingly or be informed of, for example, 
blocked meters upon arrival in case of city events so you won't accidentally park in a tow zone.  Many cities (over 100 now) are uploading their local data to Waze, 
from Rio de Janeiro (the first partner with Waze is really excited about rerouting traffic around garbage pickup) to Boston to Bloomington, IL; 
our proposal also serves those who choose not to download Waze. As an example, we'll be using Google Maps Places API to illustrate this application's work flow.
